# a reduce function will take a callback function as parameters and
# the call back needs to have two parameters 
# reduce functionc calls the callback by passing the current element and previous result2
# each time except for the first time, first time it passes first and second elements 
# reduce will produce only result
# if list has n elements result will have only element
